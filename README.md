What is different from Machine learning on NLP to Deep Learning on NLP

    * shallow models(e.g. SVM and logistic regression) -> dense vector representations
    * hand-crafted features ->  multi-level automatic feature


1. Distributed Represntation
    * Word embedding :  
        Measuring similarity between vectors is possible, using measures such as cosine similarity. 
        Word Embedding are often used as the first data processing layer in a deep learning model.
    * Word2vec
        
        * Frameworks providing embedding tools and methods
