### pre-trained models for speech recognition


I've been inspired by the fast.ai and their 'advocated' approach of starting with pre-trained models 
- so here's my two cents in terms of existing resources. Not all of them have a downloadable weight file (VGG-style), 
but they probably can serve as a good starting point.

- Wavenet, obviously :-) https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet
- DeepSpeech https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech
- https://github.com/pannous/tensorflow-speech-recognition
- Baidu again https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc
- The Torch variety https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.torch
